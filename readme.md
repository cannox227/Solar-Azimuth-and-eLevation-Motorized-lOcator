# :rainbow: Building process
    git pull
    git submodule update --init
    cd pico-sdk
    git submodule update --init

Add to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) the current directory (pico-sdk folder) as env variable:
    
    export PICO_SDK_PATH=path_to/pico-sdk
<br>

    cd ..
    cd SALMO_pico_fw
    mkdir build
    cd build 
    cmake ..
    cd src
    make -j4

After this process some binaries files will be created. <br>The suitable one is the `.uf2` file, which is located into `SALMO_pico_fw/build/src`.<br>
Now you can start the board in bootloader mode:
1. Disconnect the board
1. Hold the `BOOTSEL` button
1. Connect the device to your computer

Then drag and drop the `.uf2` file to `RPI-RP2` mass storage device.

In order to make this process faster, you can simply navigate to `SALMO_pico_fw/src/` and execute `build.sh` or `build_and_flash.sh` to respectively build or build and flash the project. :nail_care:

# :briefcase: Adding new drivers or libraries
If you want to add a new driver or library please keep this tree structure
```
ðŸ“¦ SALMO_pico_fw
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ build
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ src
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ your_lib
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚ your_lib docs
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ CMakeLists.txt
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ your_lib.c.
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ your_lib.h
```
Every library needs some sort of documentation, and of course a cmake file!
