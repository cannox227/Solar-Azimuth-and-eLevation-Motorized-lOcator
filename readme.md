# :rainbow: Building process
    git pull
    git submodule update --init --recursive

Add to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) the current directory (pico-sdk folder) as env variable:
    
`export PICO_SDK_PATH=<path_to>/pico-sdk`

and then:

    cd SALMO_pico_fw
    mkdir build
    cd build 
    cmake ..
    cd src
    make -j4

After this process some binaries files will be created. <br>The suitable one is the `.uf2` file, which is located into `SALMO_pico_fw/build/src`.<br>
Now you can start the board in bootloader mode:
1. Disconnect the board
1. Hold the `BOOTSEL` button
1. Connect the device to your computer

Then drag and drop the `.uf2` file to `RPI-RP2` mass storage device.

## Picotool
If you want to install picotool and easily flash when RP2040 is not in BOOTSEL mode, you need to follow these steps:

Linux:

    sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev
    
Mac:

    xcode-select --install
    brew install libusb
    brew link --overwrite libusb
    
and then do:

    cd picotool
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

After that, you must give execution permissions to the scripts:

    cd ../../SALMO_pico_fw/src
    sudo chmod +x build.sh
    sudo chmod +x flash.sh
    sudo chmod +x build_and_flash.sh

If something on MacOS doesn't work use

    sudo chown -R {username}:{workgroup} ppse-2021

Then, you can simply navigate to `SALMO_pico_fw/src/` and execute `build.sh`, `flash.sh` or `build_and_flash.sh` to respectively build, flash or build and flash the project. :nail_care:

# :briefcase: Adding new drivers or libraries
If you want to add a new driver or library please keep this tree structure
```
ðŸ“¦ SALMO_pico_fw
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ build

 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ CMakeLists.txt

Every library needs some sort of documentation, and of course a cmake file!
